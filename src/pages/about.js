        <p>
          My name is George Davituri. I am studying and researching Comp Sci which is slightly overused word LOLðŸ˜‚:) Literally obsessed with coding & innovative technology.
          My knowledge in general is deep but, I have only been coding for a few years. Also I enjoy creating unique UI's using new/top trend Front-end libraries and frameworks.

          I am now actively looking for some fun projects to work on.
          I like challenges of all sorts so if you are looking for someone to work with, don't hesitate to drop me a message with any suggestions. Looking forward to hearing from you!ðŸ™‚
