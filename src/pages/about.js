        <p>
          My name is George Davituri. I am studying and researching Comp Sci
          which is slightly overused word LOL <span>😂</span>. Literally
          obsessed with coding & technology, overall. My knowledge in general is
          deep but, I have only been coding for a few years. Also I enjoy
          creating unique UI's using new/top trend Front-end libraries and
          frameworks.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />I am now actively looking for some fun projects to work on. I
          like challenges of all sorts so if you are looking for someone to work
          with, don't hesitate to drop me a message with any suggestions.
          Looking forward to hearing from you! <span>🙂</span>
