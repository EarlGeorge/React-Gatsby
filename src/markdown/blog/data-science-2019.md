### So how do I start self-teaching in data science? Some people say you should start with learning Linux, other people say data scientists should be learning Scala not Python or R.

You can use Scala but if you dont don't know it yet you can start with something more friendly to you : ))

Python is great & pretty easy language, I am still researching, playing around and definitely planning to dive deeper in this 'ecosystem' too. 99% its use case is in Data Science field like training the model.

### And what about R?

It is good at mathematical modeling and thatâ€™s about it. With Python you get a lot more return on your learning investment, and can do a larger range of tasks do some cool things using it.
