<H1> I have been hacked! No.. I MEAN HACKED! </H1>

Targeted hacks can on the surface look like any other old virus or exploit.  <B> When you find you have been targeted, threatened, and even silenced while being fired.. </b><i>well that's a different story.</i> 

<B>DevOps/SysAdmins - Follow the bits..</B>
Are needed more than ever because without often a higher level of privilege these new exploits are going unnoticed longer than usual.  


<li>Volunteer to help with RT information...
<li>If you see something, say something...
<li>Save screenshots with dates
<li>Save the code on a USB stick clearly marked 
<li>Make a copy and disable file extensions to view any text 
<li>Report here, report there, report everywhere...

DevOps/Admins with the changes in Apple's security introduced in BigSur  this exploit becomes increasingly hard to notice.  Elevated privileges and access to volumes are needed by virus checkers to even notice the problems that <i>could exist</i>.   

<B> Follow your gut...</B> Hard drive lights blinking more than usual, a quick flash on the screen, a quick 2FA confirmation screen you did not expect or network traffic even network traffic on subnet 169 between devices that are chattering <B>  -- ALL OF THESE are in play this year...<B>
